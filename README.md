### Simulate and implement go back n sliding window protocol ###
In computer networks sliding window protocol is a method to transmit data on a network. Sliding window protocol is applied on the Data Link Layer of OSI model. At data link layer data is in the form of frames. In Networking, Window simply means a buffer which has data frames that needs to be transmitted.Both sender and receiver agrees on some window size. If window size=w then after sending w frames sender waits for the acknowledgement (ack) of the first frame.
As soon as sender receives the acknowledgement of a frame it is replaced by the next frames to be transmitted by the sender. If receiver sends a collective or cumulative acknowledgement to sender then it understands that more than one frames are properly received.

### Simulate CRC error detection algorithmfor noisy channel ###
A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data error.
